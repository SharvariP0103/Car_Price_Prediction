Introduction

Predicting car prices accurately is crucial for both buyers and sellers. This project combines the power of machine learning with the simplicity of web development to create a user-friendly interface for predicting car prices. By leveraging Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, we provide an interactive platform where users can input car details and receive predicted prices in real-time.

Features

- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of regression algorithms for predicting car prices.
- Web Application: Deployment of the machine learning model as a web application using Flask.
- User Interface: A clean and intuitive interface for users to input car details and receive price predictions.
- Scalability: Designed to handle multiple users simultaneously, ensuring responsiveness and reliability.
- Integration: Easy integration with existing web applications or frameworks for seamless deployment.
